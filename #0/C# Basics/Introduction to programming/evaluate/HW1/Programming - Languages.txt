Many programming languages exist today.Here you can find the list of the programming languages similar to C#:   C, C++, Python, Java, and so on.
Both C# and Java drew from the C/C++ (and Objective C, and others) to define their syntax. Java and C# are similar programming languages that are statically, strongly, and manifestly typed, both are class-based object-oriented, both are designed with semi-interpretation or runtime compilation in mind, both use garbage-collection like C and C++.C# is a strongly-typed object-oriented language designed to give the optimum blend of simplicity, expressiveness, and performance. The .NET platform is centered around a Common Language Runtime (similar to a JVM) and a set of libraries which can be exploited by a wide variety of languages which are able to work together by all compiling to an intermediate language (IL). C# and .NET are a little symbiotic: some features of C# are there to work well with .NET, and some features of .NET are there to work well with C# .
Python is strongly typed language - the object's type cannot be changed and can`t generate ".exe". Python is a script language, so C# is statically typed that means the variables are declared to the compiler to be of a specific type. The code is generated based on certain knowledge about the variables use at run-time.  C++ compiles down to machine code, but C# 'compiles' down to CLR, which ASP.NET interprets. On the other side the biggest difference between Java and C# is in the implementation. Java uses the notion of type erasure to implement generics and C# on the other hand, by virtue of the CLR, implement generics all they way down to the byte code -  the benefits are preformance improvements, deep type safety verification and reflection.
